# Notes


## Auth
  - Right now endpoints themselves aren't authenticated, just the page loads
  - In the future it would be nice to fix this, but as it stands auth is working well


## Bugs
  - Not Refreshing the browser and hitting "/" takes you to the login page. After a single refresh, it works as usual


## TODO
- [ ] All the accounts list in the transactions page to listen for new accounts/updated balances
